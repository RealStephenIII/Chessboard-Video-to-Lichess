# Chessboard-Video-to-Lichess
It doesn't work because any shadows on the board will falsely trigger the program, but it was fun and I put a lot of work into it.

The idea is to take a video input of pieces moving on a chess board and translate that into moving the pieces on lichess.org.

I made a presentation about it for one of my classes if you want to know more
